# Whac-a-mole

1st Project - Game

This game will be an online simulation of the arcade game where kids hit moles that pop up with a hammer.
The speed on which the mole appears on the screen will increase depending on the current score.

There are two possible versions depending on the time and how I progress:

Version 1

- Winning condition: Having more than 50 points in 1 minute.
- Loosing condition: Having less than 50 points in 1 minute.

Version 2

- Winning condition: You finish a minute hiting moles.
- Loosing condition: Hitting a different animal three times.
